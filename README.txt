ADDITIONAL TERMS:  The Doom 3 BFG Edition GPL Source Code is also subject to certain additional terms. You should have received a copy of these additional terms immediately following the terms and conditions of the GNU GPL which accompanied the Doom 3 BFG Edition GPL Source Code.

____________________________________________

4) GETTING THE SOURCE CODE
___________________________________

This project's GitHub.net Git repository can be checked out through Git with the following instruction set: 

	> git clone https://github.com/RobertBeckebans/RBDOOM-3-BFG.git

If you don't want to use git, you can download the source as a zip file at
	https://github.com/RobertBeckebans/RBDOOM-3-BFG/archive/master.zip



___________________________________________________________________

5) COMPILING ON WIN32 WITH VISUAL C++ 2013 EXPRESS EDITION
__________________________________________________________

1. Download and install the Visual C++ 2013 Express Edition.

2. Download and install the latest CMake.

3. Generate the VC13 projects using CMake by doubleclicking a matching configuration .bat file in the neo/ folder.

4. Use the VC13 solution to compile what you need:
	RBDOOM-3-BFG/build/RBDoom3BFG.sln
	
5. Download ffmpeg-20140405-git-ec8789a-win32-shared.7z from ffmpeg.zeranoe.com/builds/win32/shared

6. Extract the FFmpeg DLLs to your current build directory under RBDOOM-3-BFG/build/


__________________________________

6) COMPILING ON GNU/LINUX
_________________________


1. You need the following dependencies in order to compile RBDoom3BFG with all features:
 
	On Debian or Ubuntu:

		> apt-get install cmake libsdl1.2-dev libopenal-dev libavcodec-dev libavformat-dev libavutil-dev libswscale-dev
	
	On Fedora

		// TODO add ffmpeg libs for bink videos
		
		> yum install cmake SDL-devel openal-devel
	
	On openSUSE (tested in 13.1)
	
		> zypper in openal-soft-devel cmake libSDL-devel libffmpeg1-devel
	
		For SDL 2 replace "libSDL-devel" with "libSDL2-devel".
		"libffmpeg1-devel" requires the PackMan repository. If you don't have that repo, and don't want to add it, remove the "libffmpeg1-devel" option and compile without ffmpeg support.
		If you have the repo and compiles with ffmpeg support, make sure you download "libffmpeg1-devel", and not "libffmpeg-devel".
	
	Instead of SDL1.2 development files you can also use SDL2. Install SDL 2.0 and add to the cmake parameters -DSDL2=ON
	
	SDL2 has better input support (especially in the console) and better 
	support for multiple displays (especially in fullscreen mode).


2. Generate the Makefiles using CMake:

	> cd neo/
	> ./cmake-eclipse-linux-profile.sh
	
3. Compile RBDOOM-3-BFG targets with

	> cd ../build
	> make

___________________________________________________

7) INSTALLATION, GETTING THE GAMEDATA, RUNNING THE GAME
__________________________________________


If you use the prebuilt Win32 binaries then simply extract them to your
C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\SteamApps\common\Doom 3 BFG Edition\ directory and run RBDoom3BFG.exe.




The following instructions are primarily intented for Linux users and all hackers on other operating systems.

To play the game, you need the game data from a legal copy of the game, which 
unfortunately requires Steam for Windows - Steam for Linux or OSX won't do, because
(at least currently) the Doom 3 BFG game is only installable on Steam for Windows.
Even the DVD version of Doom 3 BFG only contains encrytped data that is decoded
by Steam on install.

Fortunately, you can run Steam in Wine to install Doom3 BFG and afterwards copy the 
game data somewhere else to use it with native executables.
Winetricks ( http://winetricks.org/ ) makes installing Windows Steam on Linux really easy.

Anyway:

1. Install Doom 3 BFG in Steam (Windows version), make sure it's getting 
   updated/patched.

2. Create your own Doom 3 BFG directory, e.g. /path/to/Doom3BFG/

3. Copy the game-data's base dir from Steam to that directory 
   (e.g. /path/to/Doom3BFG/), it's in
	/your/path/to/Steam/steamapps/common/DOOM 3 BFG Edition/base/

4. Copy your RBDoom3BFG executable that you created in 5) or 6) and the FFmpeg DLLs to your own 
   Doom 3 BFG directory (/path/to/Doom3BFG).
   
   Your own Doom 3 BFG directory now should look like:
	/path/to/Doom3BFG/
	 ->	RBDoom3BFG (or RBDoom3BFG.exe on Windows)
	 -> avcodec-55.dll
	 -> avdevice-55.dll
	 -> avfilter-4.dll
	 -> avformat-55.dll
	 -> avutil-52.dll
	 -> postproc-52.dll
	 -> swresample-0.dll
	 -> swscale-2.dll
	 ->	base/
		 ->	classicmusic/
		 ->	_common.crc
		 ->	(etc)

5. Run the game by executing the RBDoom3BFG executable.

6. Enjoy

7. If you run into bugs, please report them, see 11)

8) CHANGES
__________________________________________

- Flexible build system using CMake

- Linux support (32 and 64 bit)

- Win64 support

- OpenAL Soft sound backend primarily developed for Linux but works on Windows as well

- Bink video support through FFmpeg

- Soft shadows using PCF hardware shadow mapping

	The implementation uses sampler2DArrayShadow and PCF which usually
	requires Direct3D 10.1 however it is in the OpenGL 3.2 core so it should
	be widely supported.
	All 3 light types are supported which means parallel lights (sun) use
	scene independent cascaded shadow mapping.
	The implementation is very fast with single taps (400 fps average per
	scene on a GTX 660 ti OC) however I defaulted it to 16 taps so the shadows look
	really good which should give you stable 100 fps on todays hardware (2014).

- Changed light interaction shaders to use Half-Lambert lighting like in Half-Life 2 to 
	make the game less dark. https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Half_Lambert


___________________________________________________

9) CONSOLE VARIABLES
__________________________________________

r_useShadowMapping 1 - Use soft shadow mapping instead of hard stencil shadows


___________________________________________________

10) KNOWN ISSUES
__________________________________________

Doom 3 wasn't designed to work with shadow maps so:

- Some lights cause shadow acne with shadow mapping
- Some shadows might almost disappear due to the shadow filtering

___________________________________________________

11) BUG REPORTS
__________________________________________

RBDOOM-3-BFG is not perfect, it is not bug free as every other software.
For fixing as much problems as possible we need as much bug reports as possible.
We cannot fix anything if we do not know about the problems.

The best way for telling us about a bug is by submitting a bug report at our GitHub bug tracker page:

	https://github.com/RobertBeckebans/RBDOOM-3-BFG/issues?state=open

The most important fact about this tracker is that we cannot simply forget to fix the bugs which are posted there. 
It is also a great way to keep track of fixed stuff.

If you want to report an issue with the game, you should make sure that your report includes all information useful to characterize and reproduce the bug.

    * Search on Google
    * Include the computer's hardware and software description ( CPU, RAM, 3D Card, distribution, kernel etc. )
    * If appropriate, send a console log, a screenshot, an strace ..
    * If you are sending a console log, make sure to enable developer output:

              RBDoom3BFG.exe +set developer 1 +set logfile 2

NOTE: We cannot help you with OS-specific issues like configuring OpenGL correctly, configuring ALSA or configuring the network.
