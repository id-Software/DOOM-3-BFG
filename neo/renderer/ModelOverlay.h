	Overlays are used for adding decals on top of dynamic models.
	Projects an overlay onto deformable geometry and can be added to
	a render entity to allow decals on top of dynamic models.
	This does not generate tangent vectors, so it can't be used with
	light interaction shaders. Materials for overlays should always
	be clamped, because the projected texcoords can run well off the
	texture since no new clip vertexes are generated.
	Overlays with common materials will be merged together, but additional
	overlays will be allocated as needed. The material should not be
	one that receives lighting, because no interactions are generated
	for these lightweight surfaces.
