Dynamic Shadow Volume Setup

A dynamic shadow is cast from a model touching a light where either the model or light is dynamic or both.
A dynamic shadow volume extends to infinity which allows the end caps to be omitted
when the view is outside and far enough away from the shadow volume.

A dynamic shadow volume is created at run-time in this job. This job also determines whether
or not end caps need to be generated and rendered, whether or not the shadow volume needs
to be rendered with Z-Fail, and optionally calculates the shadow volume depth bounds.

The occluder triangles are optionally culled to the light projection matrix. This is
particularly important for spot lights that would otherwise cast shadows in all directions.
However, there can also be significant savings when a small point light touches a large
model like for instance a world model.
