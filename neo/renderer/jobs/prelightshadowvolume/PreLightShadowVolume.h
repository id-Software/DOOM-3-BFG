Pre-Light Shadow Volume Setup

A pre-light shadow is cast from static world geometry touching a static light.
A pre-light shadow volume does not extend to infinity but is capped at the light
boundaries which means the end caps always need to be rendered.

A pre-light shadow volume is created at map compile time and this job determines whether or
not the shadow volume needs to be rendered with Z-Fail.
