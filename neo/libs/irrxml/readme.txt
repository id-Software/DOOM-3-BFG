1. Directory structure overview
==========================================================================

  You will find some directories after decompressing the archive in which
  came the SDK. These are:
  
  \doc         Documentation of irrXML.
  \example     A short example showing how to use the parser with solution
               and make files.
  \src         The source code of irrXML.   

==========================================================================
2. How to use
==========================================================================

  For Linux/Unix users: Simply go into the directory /example and run
  'make'. This will create a sample project using irrXML.
  
  Windows users: Just add the source files to your project. That's all. 
  For more information see the documentation in the \doc directory.
    
  Alternatively, you could compile irrXML as .lib, after this you would
  only need to use the irrXML.h header file, nothing more.


==========================================================================
3. Requirements
==========================================================================

  You can use one of the following compilers/IDEs to develop applications
  with irrXML. However, other compilers/IDEs make work  as well, 
  we simply didn't test them. 
  
  * gcc 3.2
  * gcc 3.3
  * Visual Studio 6.0
  * Visual Studio.NET (7.0)
  * Visual Studio.NET 2003 (7.1)
  * Visual Studio.NET 2005 (8.0)
  * DevC++ 4.9 & gcc (project files included)
