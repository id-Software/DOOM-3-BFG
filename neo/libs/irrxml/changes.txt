Changes in version 1.2 (13 November 2005)

- irrXML now supports CDATA.

- some small bug fixes have been made, making irrXML compatible for .NET users who
  have to struggle with the famous bool return bug in the .NET framework.

- There are two new method overloads: getAttributeValueAsInt() and 
  getAttributeValueAsFloat() now also take the index of the attribute as parameter. 
  Thanks to Patrik Müller who suggested and implemented this initially, the same 
  for the CDATA support.

Changes in version 1.1 (02 July 2005)

- irrxml is now also able to parse embedded text correctly when it is shorter than
  2 characters. 
  
- irrxml now treats whitespace quite intelligent and doesn't report it when it is
  obviously used for formatting the xml file. (Text won't be reported when it only contains
  whitespace and is shorter than 3 characters)
  
- irrxml won't crash anymore when the xml file is malformatted and an attribute has
  an opening but no closing attribute.
  
- Removed a documentation which claimed that the xml parser doesn't work as the xml standard
  when replacing special characters, which wasn't true.
